### Background {-}
I was born in Chongqing, a mountainous city in China that's also famous for cyperpunk-like buildings, numbing Szechuan cuisine and spicy hotpot (Yes I love my hometown!). I moved to Beijing with my parents since 10 and live there now. I came to study in the U.S. since 2013, spent 2 years of high school in Vermont, and stayed in New York for 6 years. 

I went to New York University for undergrad and graduated with a major in Computer Science and minor in Business Studies. Through various experiences I had developed an interest in data analytics and decided to pivot to data science while developing my business sense.

Now, I am a Master student at Ross School of Business, University of Michigan, studying Business Analytics. I hope to work as a Data Scientist or Data Analyst at an impact-driven tech company after this graduate program and become a Product Manager in 2-3 years.
