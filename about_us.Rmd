### Background {-}
I was born in Chongqing, a mountainous city in China that's famous for the cyberpunk-like buildings, numbing Szechuan cuisine and the spicy hotpot. I moved to Beijing with my parents when I was 10 and came to study in the U.S. since 2013. I spent my first 2 years in Vermont, and stayed in New York for 6 years. 

I graduated from New York University with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Business Studies. Through various internships, class projects and club activities, I had developed an interest in data analytics and decided to pivot to data science where I can translate raw data to valuable business insights. 

Recently, I have enrolled in the Master of Business Analytics program at the Ross School of Business, University of Michigan. I hope to work as a Data Scientist or Data Analyst at an impact-driven company in the tech space after this graduate program and become a Product Manager in 2-3 years.
