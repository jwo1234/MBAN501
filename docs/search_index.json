Our vision was to pave the way for future MBAn classes by leading by example, failing fast, and building a community of compassionate leaders in our business cohort. We strive to apply class concepts to real world situations, such as managing a team or in a leadership role to foster great team environments. By delegating specified team roles based on individual skills, we ensured efficient communication and problem solving. We agreed to split work evenly and always ask questions when we needed clarification, regardless of the topic. Establishing these rules early on provided a comfortable learning environment for all members of the team. Our team values included respect, dedication, growth, and adaptation. Initial Stage Our group topic was something of much debate at the beginning of the term. Uncertain with what we wanted to do, we started to brainstorm a few ideas that centered around teams in industries with nothing really sticking. However, a question was asked if we knew what we wanted to do post-graduation for our professional career. All of us had an idea of what we wanted to do but were unsure of the specifics that came with different industries such as work-life balance, recruiting processes, and team structure. Because of this, the team narrowed the idea to “Business Analyst in Teams” ideally trying to get a better understanding of industry roles. Initial research was done to get a base understanding of the different roles business analysts can perform in industry. From industry, we discovered 3 main sectors: Finance, Consulting and Technology. We found that teams in these 3 industries can vary significantly and wanted to get a real word perspective of the responsibilities for our report. Because of this, the team decided it would be best to reach out to different LinkedIn connections in these fields for interviews. Interview Leads Consulting McKinsey ZS Solutions EY (tech consulting) Finance JP Morgan Goldman Sachs Jackson National Tech Google Amazon Microsoft We moved on to interview current business analysts in the industry that most interests us because everyone of us has developed an interest in a sector. Additionally, when we were unable to get a specific piece of information from a particular interviewee, we communicated with the other members of our group to build an emphasis on that aspect for his/her interviews. We also found members during this process who were better suited to work on the presentation of our Bookdown-powered website, while the rest of us shifted our attention to research and interviews to fully utilize our individual strengths. To tackle the learning curve of R and Bookdown, we had the more experienced members spend time teaching the entire group the essential elements to make edits and changes to book contents. We also sought help on making Git commits, pulls, and pushes to work together better on a shared software project. Additionally, we communicated often and learned to make commits and pushes sequentially to avoid Git merge conflicts. Change in Project Scope A few weeks into the project, we learned the procedures of user identification and drafting user stories. As we identified our key users through the in-class exercise and conducted user interviews with our primary and secondary users, we realized that instead of a narrow focus on how business analysts work in their day-to-day job, our users shared an interest in how to prepare for a Business Analyst role and learn more about nuances of the roles in these three industries. To serve the evolving demands of our users, our team decided to expand the scope of our product from “Business Analyst in Teams” to taking a deeper look into the Business Analyst roles in three popular industries. Mid-point Evaluation After reviewing the data from our group’s in class survey, we realized that the team was struggling with efficiency during meetings. To increase productivity, we decided to set meeting agendas, added intentionally named meetings to our google calendars (like “update user stories” instead of “MBAn 501 Group Meeting”), assign work-to-be-done before each meeting, and strictly follow start and end times. We also communicated more often to avoid overlaps in content production and constantly checked-in with each other to make sure we were on the right track for our timeline. These changes helped increase the productivity of each meeting, and our work quality was able to stay consistent in less time. One thing we did well since the start of the project was implementing Agile work practices. For each sprint (every homework deadline in the context of MBAn 501), we prioritized creating a working product first and worked on it progressively before the deadline. After conducting the user interviews, we reflected on the features of our product and made adjustments accordingly to make sure that our product served the users’ changing needs. We also reviewed our charter and made appropriate adjustments to promote our team efficiency. We maintained the things we did well and made critical adjustments as a team, and the teamwork quality was improved for the rest of the project. From this project, we truly understood the advantages of Agile methodology and learned the importance of team charter, frequent evaluation on the team progress, and using intentional measures to improve teamwork quality without sacrificing team bonding.
