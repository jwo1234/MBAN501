To increase productivity, we’ve decided to set meeting agendas, assign work-to-be-done before each meeting, and strictly follow start and end times. Our group handles challenges and change by communicating and reaching out for help when needed. We divided work based on our individual strengths, and spent time learning and teaching RMarkdown/Git/GitHub to each other. More experienced members took initiative to make sure every member of the group knew how to edit the document, pull, and push changes. We implemented Agile work practices throughout our project. For each sprint (every homework deadline in the context of MBAn 501), we prioritized creating a working product first and worked on it progressively in the given time. After conducting the user interviews, we reflected on the features of our product and made adjustments accordingly to make sure it serves the users needs. We also reviewed our team charter to make appropriate adjustments that promote the team efficiency. We’ve decided to expand the scope of our project from “Business Analyst in Teams”, which puts more emphasis on the working experience of Business Analysts in actual work settings, to demystify the Business Analyst role in three popular industries, provide insight on how to prepare for an entry-level position as well as introducing what the career trajectory looks like. In the time we have left in this project, our team will set detailed agendas, add intentionally named meetings to our google calendars, and produce a working product that we are all proud of. We will communicate more often to avoid overlaps in content production and constantly check-in with each other to make sure we are on the right track for our timeline.
