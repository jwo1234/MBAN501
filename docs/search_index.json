Since we are the first cohort of the MBAn program, all our peers and future MBAn students most likely consider some variation of business analytics role as their immediate career option. Our project aims to develop a broad framework to understand and navigate the Business Analyst role in different industries such as Consulting, Finance, and Tech, with an emphasis on how Business Analyst works in team settings.   Purpose and Objective The purpose of this project is to gain valuable insights into the specific responsibilities of a business analyst in different industries, which we can use in the coming months to choose a career path. The objective is to understand the responsibilities and skills needed to work in these fields including both technical and soft skills. From there, the objective is to understand the nature of the team. We are interested in the growth and future of different positions, and finally, work/life balance.   Plan Conduct independent research on the roles and responsibilities of analysts and how they interact with other professionals in the same team. Network and interview 3 different analysts in different industries.

These requirements can be part of an IT-related project or a process improvement initiative. As a business analyst, or BA, you typically work for a consulting firm that charges clients an hourly rate for your time based on a negotiated contract. A BA travels to customer sites to meet directly with clients and view business operations firsthand. As a business analyst, you are expected to conduct surveys, perform statistical analyses and tests, make IT recommendations, suggest changes to certain processes, and create new systems. Education and Background Consulting is a wide industry with many different categories of consulting. The majority of business analyst consultants have a bachelor’s degree in business, engineering, or economics with medium or high levels of data analysis or a coding background. As a result, some computer science students who are not looking for a programming job have also become interested in this industry in recent years. Job Responsibilities Tasks are usually different for every project. However, most cases require you to evaluate your client’s business model or assess their potential risk in the future. Each case can range from a few weeks to multiple months of time to work while some may even take 6-10 months. However, you are expected to follow a certain framework given by either your client or your manager for your evaluation. You are expected to present clients with visualization of your evaluation along with your risk assessment and prediction for longevity in the future. Your final output will be professional yet easy to understand because your core value is the connection between hard-core data/technology and the normal people in the business world. Skill Sets Skills take on a more holistic approach as you are expected to be with customers and work through their problems with them and then report back to them. Soft Skills: Problem-solving Make the Most of Presentations Creative thinking Be Flexible Thinking conceptually and practically Communicating clearly and empathetically Collaboration with all job levels Organization and time management Curiosity Credibility “Consulting Fit” = Strong Academics with good experience and being apart of high achieving teams Attention to detail Hard Skills: Excel, Microsoft Outlook/Team, PowerPoint ABAP, Tableau (If you are on technology track) Team Structure The team of a consultant is always changing depending on the nature of the current project. The team usually consists of a few business analysts. The team you work with varies every project. Typically, there will be one Partner, one Senior Manager, one Junior Manager, several senior consultants, and each of these individuals will supervise a small number of Junior Consultants/Business Analysts. Usually partners and senior managers taking 99% of credit while doing 15% of work. Team Dynamic Typically, everyone works on their assigned jobs and meets their deadlines. People can become angry with one another if tasks are not completed on time or to specifications, and conflict can arise as a result. The atmosphere is generally laid-back, although everyone is expected to put in a minimum of 40 hours per week. The lower your level, the more over time and menial labor you must perform. Work Life Balance Realistically, you’re on the clock from 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM and this may not include lunch, travel or dinner. Travel is very important because clients will be across the country and you are expected to meet them on time. You can expect 70-80 hour weeks. The very typical cycle is flying out on Monday and staying near the client until Thursday night or Friday Morning then flying. While flying, you are expected to work on the plane and in the airport. There is no overtime pay whatsoever because you are paid by commission on projects as well as salary. If you are not traveling, your manager will determine your work location. Some managers want you to be in the office every day, while others only require you to be there a few days each week or even allow you to work from home. There is no day to day. Every day is different. You are working around the clock to finish your deliverables. Performance is evaluated at the end of the year in December. Entry level analysts are evaluated on a bell curve where most clients are on the curve. If you are ranked greater than 50% of analysts, a larger bonus will be given. Analysts are graded on their yearly performance by their engagement manager and directors. Recruiting Information Recruiting for consulting is infamous for the difficult case preps. This requires learning the structure, developing a framework, asking qualifying questions and then answering technical and mental math problems. Apply, 1st round Interview 2nd Round Interview 3rd Round Interview WWYD to prepare for this role (before applying) During the recruiting process, many may tell you it’s easy to switch tracks inside the firm. However, it wasn’t true for most companies. To be able to switch to another type of consulting within the same company, one needs to build connections with other case managers because they need to invite you to their team. You should also be aware that your working schedule is rarely 9-5 therefore make sure to prioritize your work life balance before you apply. Resources at Ross At Ross, there are a few different resources for consulting preparation. Ross offers consulting clubs for students to join. There are consulting case competitions that professors host to help prepare students. Overall, there are peer coaching and career coaching interviews that you can sign up for to mock interviews. OYM coaches are always available to help prepare and give advice. Industry Culture Consulting firms are extremely diverse. People will have plenty of possibilities to interact with people from various cultural backgrounds. In addition to compensation for most travel expenses, some companies also provide annual wellness funds. These funds may be used for anything that may help the physical and emotional wellbeing of employees. However, despite its outward appearance of friendliness, there’s always lots of politics and conflict going on behind scenes. Typically, company executives do the right thing and assist their staff to thrive, but their motivation is mostly financial. Trends in the Industry Consulting firms strive to keep up with market trends, and many firms have a tendency to establish relevant departments as quickly as feasible. Few companies have lately introduced a department dedicated to digital emerging technologies with an emphasis on block chain, NFT, and crypto currency in order to better serve their clients’ needs in the digital world. Salary Career Advancement and Exit Opportunities Similar to the majority of consulting positions, there are numerous prospects for career progression. In a few years, a large number of individuals would rise to Senior Consultant/Associate, Manager, Senior Manager, Team Leader, and ultimately Partner if they chose to advance vertically in the industry with managerial jobs. With the current industry trend favoring technology, big data, and computer programming consultants have new opportunities to enter these spaces especially those with a background in coding to take on roles such as data scientists or programming positions. In addition, many individuals who have worked for larger companies for a few years tend to switch to smaller companies in order to acquire greater control over the project in terms of duties, working hours, and salary. Many consulting firms also sponsor MBA programs for their analysts after they have worked for a few years. Many consultants opt into these benefits to return to the company after schooling.

One’s responsibilities typically include defining metrics, developing reports on internal/external data, performing ad-hoc data analytics, and designing dashboards. Both technical and soft skills are important for a business analyst in tech. An analyst often needs to work with cross-functional teams, communicate with customers and stakeholders, give presentations on data insights, and collaborate with the engineers and researchers. It’s also important to note that a data analyst is often synonymous with a business analyst in certain companies, and many analyst positions in tech share the same responsibility as a business analyst but are given different, often more specific, titles for the specific areas they focus on.

They typically work for 8 to 10 hours per day. But since a BA is often asked to perform ad-hoc analysis on internal and external data for project teams, the amount of daily responsibility varies greatly depending on the complexity of the project and the number of projects they have simultaneously. Industry Average Working Hours: 8-10 hrs Skill Sets Hard Skills: SQL (basic query, join methods, aggregate functions, window functions) for ETL &amp; data mining Advanced Excel (Pivot Tables, Power Pivots, VBA, Power Query, etc.) Python (basic Python data structures, list and string manipulation) AB Testing (Basic stats knowledge, hypothesis testing) Preparing and executing presentation slides on business level data Soft Skills: Designing business metrics Problem solving skills Communication skills Recruiting Process Job Search When you start the recruiting process, it is important to conduct some research for jobs you are interested in.

Job Search Strategy select the companies you want to target (refer to you LAMP list) in the filter on a job searching site (refer to Job Posting Sites below) search for “Analyst” instead of “Business Analyst” in the search bar Prioritize the “Business Analyst” postings but make sure to read job descriptions for all the Analyst positions and see if those specific roles share similar responsibilities as a BA If the job description of a non-BA Analyst position shares great resemblance with a typical BA role, and your experience and skill sets align with the qualifications, be sure to apply to these as well. Refer to a typical job description of a BA position Tips on reading job descriptions Read each bullet point of the job description and identify the soft skills, hard skills that the bullet point emphasizes. Highlight these key skills on your resume and your stories prepared for the Behavioral Interview Emphasizing these skills on your resume will help you pass the resume screening often conducted by AI-powered resume screening systems used widely among tech companies Identify entry-level positions Roles that require 1-2 years of experience with data and business analytics is typically an entry-level position Apply The sites below are commonly-used resources for finding job posting and sending your application: Company’s Job portal (example: Amazon job postings) LinkedIn Glassdoor Indeed Ross Recruit Handshake Interviews After you apply for a position and your resume pass the screening, you will go through a series of interviews to eventually land a job in tech companies Typical Interview Process Online Assessment (1 round) Phone Interview (1-2 rounds) On-site Interviews (4-5 rounds in one day) Online Assessment HR will send you a link to their Online Assessment (OA) for the position You will be tested on basic coding skills like SQL and Python in a given time constraint Once passed, you will move on to the phone interviews Phone Interviews There are often 2 rounds of phone interviews at tech companies: 1 round of technical interview: more difficult than OA and you will need to explain your approach to the interviewer as you solve the given prompt.

To increase productivity, we’ve decided to set meeting agendas, assign work-to-be-done before each meeting, and strictly follow start and end times. Our group handles challenges and change by communicating and reaching out for help when needed. We divided work based on our individual strengths, and spent time learning and teaching RMarkdown/Git/GitHub to each other. More experienced members took initiative to make sure every member of the group knew how to edit the document, pull, and push changes. We implemented Agile work practices throughout our project. For each sprint (every homework deadline in the context of MBAn 501), we prioritized creating a working product first and worked on it progressively in the given time. After conducting the user interviews, we reflected on the features of our product and made adjustments accordingly to make sure it serves the users needs. We also reviewed our team charter to make appropriate adjustments that promote the team efficiency. We’ve decided to expand the scope of our project from “Business Analyst in Teams”, which puts more emphasis on the working experience of Business Analysts in actual work settings, to demystify the Business Analyst role in three popular industries, provide insight on how to prepare for an entry-level position as well as introducing what the career trajectory looks like. In the time we have left in this project, our team will set detailed agendas, add intentionally named meetings to our google calendars, and produce a working product that we are all proud of. We will communicate more often to avoid overlaps in content production and constantly check-in with each other to make sure we are on the right track for our timeline.
