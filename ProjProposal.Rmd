## MBAN 501 Project Proposal
### We Hate Python

#### **Introduction and Background**
The goal of our project proposal is to develop a broad framework to understand and navigate the role of a Business Analyst in different industries such as Consulting, Finance, and Tech, with an emphasis on how Business Analyst works in a team setting. Too often, we find ourselves learning how to recruit and network to land jobs when in reality we do not know the full responsibilities and roles of an Analyst Team. 


#### **Purpose and Objective**
The purpose of this project is to gain valuable insight into the specific roles of an analyst in different industries, which we can use in the coming months to choose a career path. The objective is to understand the responsibilities and skills needed to work in these fields including both technical and soft skills. From there, the objective is to understand the nature of the team. We are interested in the growth and future of different positions, and finally, work/life balance. 


#### **Plan**
* Conduct independent research on the roles and responsibilities of analysts and how they interact with other professionals in the same team.
* Network and interview 3 different analysts in different industries. 

#### **Project Deliverables**
* A RMarkdown document about 20 pages long. 
* A presentation.
